---

## Phase 7 - Production Acceptance and Hardening

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Canonical domain cutover: DNS, Vercel aliases, production env URLs, and WordPress API base URL smoke test | ✅ Completed |
| 7.2 | Production acceptance checklist and repeatable smoke script | ✅ Completed |
| 7.3 | Live WordPress acceptance on `meinhaushalt.at` using the current plugin build | ✅ Completed |
| 7.4 | Phase 6 Playwright coverage for glossary, import/export, analytics, webhooks, and visual editor | ✅ Completed |
| 7.5 | WordPress PHP coverage for subdomain routing, browser redirect edge cases, and WooCommerce email translation | ✅ Completed |
| 7.6 | Production observability: webhook cron monitoring, failed delivery visibility, and operational runbook | ✅ Completed |
| 7.7 | Persistent API rate limiting and abuse controls for multi-instance production traffic | ✅ Completed |
| 7.8 | Neon production backup/restore drill and Stripe live-mode billing acceptance | 🔄 Neon restore drill completed; Stripe live billing acceptance postponed as an external dependency |
| 7.9 | Decide and enforce legacy Vercel alias policy | ✅ Completed |
| 7.10 | Autonomous Phase 6 acceptance suite and production acceptance integration | ✅ Completed |
| 7.11 | Autonomous SaaS acceptance for auth, project flow, translation API, and runtime sync | ✅ Completed |
| 7.12 | Full public/authenticated UI navigation audit with Playwright coverage and production release | ✅ Completed |
| 7.13 | Anti-drift guard for marketing copy: a `marketing-home.test.ts` (or lint rule) that scans `src/components/marketing/marketing-home.tsx` for hardcoded €/word tokens not sourced from `BILLING_PLANS`, so the Pro tier price and word ceiling can never silently disagree with the canonical plan again (regression of the `EUR 49 / 1M words` hero claim fixed in PR #38). | ⏳ Open |
| 7.14 | Playwright slider-alignment regression test: drive `src/components/marketing/pricing-grid.tsx` through every `BILLING_PLAN_KEYS` index and assert the thumb's centre pixel is within ±2px of the active tick label's centre. Prevents future flex/absolute layout drifts of the kind fixed in PR #38. | ⏳ Open |
| 7.15 | Stripe webhook end-to-end smoke for subscription-lifecycle: trigger `customer.subscription.deleted`, `customer.subscription.updated`, and `invoice.payment_failed` in Stripe test mode against `/api/webhooks/stripe` and assert that `Subscription.status`, `plan`, and `wordsLimit` are written as expected, with `getEffectiveWordsLimit` returning the FREE soft-cap for non-ACTIVE/TRIALING statuses. Closes the verification gap behind PR #37's grace-period policy. | ⏳ Open |

## Phase 8 - Live Commerce and Competitive Parity

Captured at the close of the 2026-05 working session. Each open item has a tracking GitHub issue; this table is the prioritised index.

| ID | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | **Stripe Checkout end-to-end** ([#56](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/56), [#61](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/61)). Stripe Live is fully provisioned (5 products, 10 prices, webhook, 13 prod env vars). Logged-in users can now subscribe via `POST /api/billing/checkout` and the `/(dashboard)/subscription` pages (`/abonnement/uebersicht`, `/abonnement/nutzung`, `/abonnement/karte-rechnungen`). Pricing CTAs route to the checkout flow. Implemented 2026-05-17. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.2 | **Switcher Weglot-parity remainder** ([#57](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/57)): multi-switcher instances, visual switcher editor (drag-on-live-preview), pre-made templates. Plugin v0.7.0 already live with admin UI / 5 flag styles / nav-menu / Gutenberg block / classic widget / responsive-hide / per-language custom flags. P2. | ⏳ Open |
| 8.3 | **Strategic Weglot competitive gaps** ([#58](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/58)): in-context visual translation editor, translation memory, glossary dashboard UI, PDF translation, multilingual sitemap, AMP verification, translation CDN. P3, sequence after 8.1. | ⏳ Open |
| 8.4 | **Housekeeping** ([#59](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/59)): remove dead `DATABASE_*` Neon-integration env vars (orphaned after the 2-dataset disconnect); delete stale `AccessibilityAttributeTranslationTest 2.php` duplicate. P4. | ⏳ Open |
| 8.5 | Stripe Live Mode provisioning (account `acct_1GRyA0FAiA6nPZyW` "Ostheimer OG", EUR, livemode), webhook + restricted `rk_live_*` key + 13 production env vars, verified via `acceptance:stripe --mode live`. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.6 | Clean 2-dataset Neon topology made real: disconnected Vercel↔Neon per-preview auto-branching, set static `DEEPGLOT_DATABASE_URL` per scope (Production→`prod` 59 MB real data, Preview+Development→`main` 31 MB test data), pruned 55→2 branches, verified Production unaffected (HTTP 200 + Stripe live PASS + redeploy). Implements the "Variant A: 2 branches" decision below. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.7 | WP plugin language-switcher suite shipped to v0.7.0 and deployed to meinhaushalt.at: admin UI, list/dropdown, 5 flag styles, drag order, 4 fixed/floating positions, JS-free checkbox dropdown, full ARIA, nav-menu integration, Gutenberg block, classic widget, responsive-hide, per-language custom flags. Two P1 render bugs (wrong active language under stripped REQUEST_URI; LinkRewriter rewriting switcher's own hrefs) caught via Playwright visual test, fixed in PR #50. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.8 | **EU-wide localization** ([#62](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/62)). Extended locale support beyond EN/DE to additional EU language codes. Public routes, auth pages, dashboard routes, and marketing metadata serve localized variants. Playwright localized route round-trip regression test added. Completed 2026-05-17. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.9 | **Localize remaining metadata** ([#66](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/66)). All remaining `<head>` metadata (title, description, OG tags) now rendered in the request locale across all supported locales. Completed 2026-05-17. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.10 | **Fix localized marketing pricing units** ([#65](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/issues/65)). Pricing page word-ceiling and price display for localized routes sourced from `BILLING_PLANS` instead of hardcoded strings, preventing the Pro tier hero claim from silently drifting across locales. Completed 2026-05-17. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.11 | **Enforce project limits from `BILLING_PLANS` on `POST /api/projects`**. Stale inline `planLimits` map omitted PRO/BUSINESS/ADVANCED/EXTENDED (fallback `?? 1`), blocking paying customers after their first project. Fixed 2026-05-28 via `getProjectsLimitForPlan()`. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.12 | **`isRealStripeCustomerId()` centralization** ([#89](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/89)). `manual_<orgId>` placeholder was not excluded by the existing `free_`-only check, causing Stripe 404s for ENTERPRISE orgs. Centralized as `isRealStripeCustomerId()` (allowlist `cus_…` pattern); adopted across three call sites. Completed 2026-05-27. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.13 | **Guard all Stripe customer API calls** ([#92](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/92)). All Stripe customer API calls use `isRealStripeCustomerId()` to avoid hitting the Stripe API with placeholder IDs. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.14 | **Require management for settings-area API routes** ([#95](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/95)). IDOR fix — project DELETE/PATCH and api-key create/revoke checked only org membership; webhooks and exclusions routes used the weaker `userHasProjectAccess`. All switched to `userCanManageProject`. Source-level guardrail test added. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.15 | **Harden project import/export** ([#96](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/96)). `MAX_IMPORT_ROWS` cap; chunked writes (one short transaction per chunk); CSV/formula injection protection (CWE-1236) via leading apostrophe; per-language scope for translators; usage attributed per language pair; PO export filename sanitized. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.16 | **Fix tsc failure on Stripe webhook test mock** ([#97](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/97)). Type-correct mock arguments so `tsc --noEmit` passes on the test files. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.17 | **Harden visual-editor session tokens** ([#98](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/98)). Language scope bound into the token; `langTo` enforced in `/manual-translations` (language-scoped translator cannot edit other languages). Rate limiting per project on the manual-translations write path. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.18 | **Add full `tsc --noEmit` typecheck to CI** ([#99](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/99)). New `typecheck` npm script; runs as a dedicated CI step after install so type errors outside the Next.js build graph are caught. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.19 | **Block SSRF in webhook delivery** ([#100](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/100)). New `src/lib/webhook-url-safety.ts` classifies private/reserved IPv4+IPv6 ranges and internal hostnames. Enforced at create/update (400) AND at dispatch (re-checks resolved IPs to defeat DNS rebinding). Redirects disabled. Response body capped at 512 chars to limit read-back. Completed 2026-05-29. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.20 | **Settings UX improvements** ([#104](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/104)). Visual editor launcher now only offers active target languages within the user's access scope; webhook URL field shows a public-HTTPS hint matching the SSRF guard. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.21 | **Require management to add/remove project languages** ([#103](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/103)). IDOR fix — `DELETE /api/projects/[id]/languages` had no authorization at all; `POST` gated only on org membership. Both now require `userCanManageProject`. Language code validated via Zod. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.22 | **Hide language add control from non-managers on Languages page** ([#106](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/106)). UI control for adding languages now only visible to managers, mirroring the API gate from PR #103. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.23 | **Block new Checkout when org already has live subscription** ([#108](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/108)). `POST /api/billing/checkout` now returns HTTP 409 when the org already has an ACTIVE or TRIALING subscription, directing to the billing portal instead. Prevents double-billing. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.24 | **Regression test for Languages-page management gating** ([#109](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/109)). Source-level guardrail asserting `AddLanguageDialog` renders only for managers; prevents silent regressions of the auth gate added in PR #103. Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.25 | **Block duplicate Checkout for PAST_DUE subscriptions** ([#110](https://github.com/ostheimer/deepglot/pull/110)). #108 only rejected ACTIVE/TRIALING; PAST_DUE orgs could start a second Stripe subscription via direct API. Extended guard via `blocksNewCheckoutForExistingSubscription()` (portal for plan changes). Completed 2026-05-30. | ✅ Completed |
| 8.26 | **Fix cancel-at-period-end billing correctness**. `POST /api/billing/cancel` no longer sets local `CANCELED` immediately (keeps paid word quota until Stripe ends the subscription). Checkout guard also blocks `INACTIVE` rows with an existing `stripeSubscriptionId` (abandoned incomplete Checkout). Billing mutations require org `OWNER`/`ADMIN`. | ✅ Completed |

## Technical Decisions

| Area | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | Server Components, API Routes, optimized for Vercel |
| Auth | NextAuth v5 | Open source, no lock-in, self-hosted compatible |
| Database | Neon (serverless PostgreSQL) | Vercel integration, serverless, generous free tier |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe, migrations, strong Next.js integration |
| Billing | Stripe | Industry standard, strong subscription support |
| UI | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Fast, customizable, accessible |
| Email | Cloudflare Email Sending | Integrated with existing Cloudflare infrastructure (`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL_API_TOKEN`) |
| Translation (Primary) | OpenAI provider abstraction | Low-cost default path, model configurable, local `mock` mode for development; `TRANSLATION_PROVIDER` accepts `openai`, `openrouter`, `ollama`, `openai-compatible`, `deepl`, `gemini`, or `mock` |
| Translation (Secondary) | DeepL provider | Optional quality-focused fallback for production-sensitive content |
| WP HTML Parser | DOMDocument (PHP native) | No external dependencies, available in all WordPress environments, used in HtmlTranslator and OutputBuffer |
| DB topology (Vercel + Neon) | Variant A: 2 branches | Neon `preview` → Vercel Development + Preview; Neon `prod` → Vercel Production only. See README "Setting up the Neon production branch". |
